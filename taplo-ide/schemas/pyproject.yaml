          A list of packages and modules to include in the final distribution.

          If your project structure differs from the standard one supported by poetry, you can specify the packages you want to include in the final distribution.

          ```toml
          [tool.poetry]
          # ...
          packages = [
              { include = "my_package" },
              { include = "extra_package/**/*.py" },
          ]

          If your package is stored inside a "source" directory, you must specify it:

          ```toml
          [tool.poetry]
          # ...
          packages = [
              { include = "my_package", from = "lib" },
          ]
          ```

          If you want to restrict a package to a specific build format you can specify it by using `format`:

          ```toml
          [tool.poetry]
          # ...
          packages = [
              { include = "my_package" },
              { include = "my_other_package", format = "sdist" },
          ]
          ```

          Using `packages` disables the package auto-detection feature meaning you have to explicitly specify the "default" package.

          Poetry is clever enough to detect Python subpackages.

          Thus, you only have to specify the directory where your root package resides.
          ```

          A list of patterns that will be included in the final package.

          You can explicitly specify to Poetry that a set of globs should be ignored or included for the purposes of packaging.

          The globs specified in the exclude field identify a set of files that are not included when a package is built.

          If a VCS is being used for a package, the exclude field will be seeded with the VCS’ ignore settings (`.gitignore` for git for example).
